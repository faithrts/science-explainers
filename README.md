# Science_Explainers

In this repo, I compile files related to my work with McGill's Office of Science Education (OSE) to make a dataset of science explainers.

## Summary
- dataset/science_txt_files: the .txt files of each article in the dataset
- dataset/science_explainers_dataset.csv: metadata of each article in the dataset
- dataset/article_urls.csv: the urls of each article in the dataset
- dataset/science_explainer_dataset_[creation/update].ipynb: the python notebook that [creates/updates] the dataset
