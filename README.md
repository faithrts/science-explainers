# Science_Explainers

In this repo, I compile files related to my work with McGill's Office of Science Education (OSE) to make a dataset of science explainers.

## Summary
- `dataset/science_txt_files`: the .txt files of each article in the dataset
- `dataset/science_explainers_dataset.csv`: metadata of each article in the dataset
- `dataset/article_urls.csv`: the urls of each article in the dataset
- `dataset/science_explainer_dataset_[creation/update].ipynb`: the python notebook that [creates/updates] the dataset
